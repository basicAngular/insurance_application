     "Times New Roman",serif'>Attacks on Data</span></b><span style='font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'> – You acknowledge that some security breaches
     involve attacks on data. For example, there are viruses and other malware
     that: (i) delete or destroy your data (sometimes individual files, but
     sometimes even an entire disk by corrupting a master boot record or other
     key element); (ii) modify your files (such as parasitic malware that
     attaches itself to a file and modifies the file to enable its own
     execution and/or propagation); and (iii) encrypt files on your drive (such
     as ransomware that uses asymmetric encryption). The best way for you to
     protect yourself from these types of attacks is frequent back-ups of your
     data to another device/location. That way, you have another copy of the data
     that the attacking software has deleted, modified, or destroyed. While we
     will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove the attacking malware
     or virus, it is your sole and exclusive responsibility to back-up all data
     and files on your device so that they can be restored in the event of an
     attack on your data. Without such a back-up, it may not be possible to
     restore the deleted/destroyed/modified data. We will have no liability for
     loss of or recovery of data, or files or loss of use of systems or networks
     arising from attacks on data.</span></li>
