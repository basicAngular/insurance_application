\par
ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER PRE-EXISTING, PRESENT OR FUTURE, AND INCLUDING STATUTORY, CONSUMER PROTECTION, COMMON LAW, INTENTIONAL TORT, INJUNCTIVE AND EQUITABLE CLAIMS) BETWEEN CUSTOMER AND DELL, its agents, employees,\~successors, assigns,\~direct and indirect subsidiaries, and any third party providing any products or services to you in connection with your purchase\~(collectively "Dell") arising from or relating in any way to your purchase of Product, this Agreement, its interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from this Agreement (including relationships with third parties who are not signatories to this Agreement), Dell's advertising or any related purchase SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION.

This transaction shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA). Any award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding on each of the parties, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Dell will be responsible for paying any individual consumer's arbitration/arbitrator fees. If you prevail on any claim that affords the prevailing party attorneys' fees, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees to you under the standards for fee shifting provided by law.

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720\ri720\sb120\sa120\qj\lang16393 These Commercial Terms of Sale (the \ldblquote\b Agreement\b0\rdblquote ), made between you (\ldblquote\b you\b0\rdblquote  or \ldblquote\b Customer\b0\rdblquote ) and Dell, govern your purchase and use of Products and Services from Dell.  \ldblquote\b Dell\b0\rdblquote  means Dell Marketing L.P. or the Dell Affiliate identified on the Dell sales documentation.  \ldblquote\b Dell Affiliate\b0\rdblquote  means a direct or indirect subsidiary of Dell Inc. located in the United States.  This Agreement is effective upon the earliest of (i) your issuance of a purchase order to Dell, (ii) your acceptance of these terms, or (iii) your agreement with a reseller that references this Agreement.  The Products and Services are solely for your internal use and may not be resold.  If you purchased through a reseller or distributor, final prices and sales terms will be between you and the reseller or distributor; however, this Agreement applies to your possession and use of Products and Services.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li720\ri720\sb120\sa120\qj A.\tab\b Definitions.  \b0\ldblquote\b Hardware\b0\rdblquote  means computer hardware, related devices and other accessories including all embedded components (excluding Software).  \ldblquote\b Software\b0\rdblquote  means any software, library, utility, tool, or other computer or program code, in object (binary) form, and \ldblquote\b Documentation\b0\rdblquote  means the related media, printed materials, online and electronic documentation, including copies.  \ldblquote\b Products\b0\rdblquote  means Hardware, Software, or both.  \ldblquote\b Services\b0\rdblquote  means services and Deliverables provided by Dell.  \ldblquote\b Deliverables\b0\rdblquote  means the tangible materials, including reports, studies, drawings, software, manuals or written procedures and recommendations that Dell delivers to you under a Statement of Work.  \ldblquote\b Third-Party Products\rdblquote\b0  means products, software, or services that are not manufactured or performed by Dell.\b\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li720\ri720\sa200\qj\b0\lang1033 B.\tab\b Additional Agreements.\b0   This Agreement, the Service Agreements and the Software Agreements (each as defined below) form a legally binding contract between you and Dell.  In the event of a conflict or ambiguity, the applicable Service Agreement or Software Agreement will take precedence over this Agreement.\b\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-357\li720\ri720\sa120\b0 2.\tab  Term; Auto-Renewal\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720\ri720\sb120\sa120\qj\lang16393 This Agreement will continue until all Services, Product warranties, or licenses have expired or been terminated. If you purchased directly from Dell, Hardware Service and non-perpetual Software licenses may be renewed if you pay a renewal invoice from Dell or continue to use the Hardware Service or Software past its initial term.  If you purchased through a reseller, the payment terms for renewal for the Hardware Service or Software licenses will be as agreed between you and the reseller.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li720\ri720\sa120\lang1033 3.\tab Quotes, Ordering, and Payment\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720\ri720\sb120\sa120\lang16393 Except for subsection B, this Section applies only to direct purchases from Dell.\b\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-357\li720\ri720\b0 i.\tab\b Quotes and Orders.\b0   \ldblquote\b Order\b0\rdblquote  means your order of Products or Services, either through {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.dell.com/" }}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf2\ul dell.com}}}}\f0\fs22  or other online process, by submitting a purchase order that references a Dell quote, or by executing a Dell order form.  Your Order is subject to acceptance by Dell.  Acceptance of one Order is independent from any other Order.  Quoted prices are effective until the expiration date of the quote, but may change due to shortages in materials or resources, increase in the cost of manufacturing, or other factors.  Orders for Third-Party Products are subject to availability and are cancellable only by Dell.  Dell is not responsible for pricing, typographical, or other errors in any offer, and may cancel orders affected by such errors.\b\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li720\ri720\sb120\sa120\qj\b0 ii.\tab\b Changed or Discontinued Products or Services.  \b0 Dell may revise or discontinue Products and Services at any time, including after Customer places an Order, but prior to Dell\rquote s shipment or performance.  As a result, Products and Services Customer receives might differ from those ordered.  However, Dell-branded Products will materially meet or exceed all published specifications for the Products.  Parts used in repairing or servicing Products may be new, equivalent-to-new, or reconditioned.\b\par
\b0 iii.\tab\b Shipping Charges; Title; Risk of Loss.\b0   Shipping and handling charges are not included in Product prices unless expressly indicated at the time of sale.  Title to Hardware passes from Dell to Customer upon shipment.  Delivery of Software is FOB Origin.  Loss or damage that occurs during shipping (including returns) is the responsibility of the party that selected the carrier.  Shipping and delivery dates are estimates only.  You must notify Dell within 21 days of your invoice date if you believe any part of your Order is missing, wrong, or damaged.\b\par
\b0 iv.\tab\b Payment.\b0   Invoices are due and payable within the time period stated on your invoice, or if not stated, within 30 days from the invoice date.  Payment must be made in the method and currency identified by Dell.  Credit approval may be revoked at any time.  Dell may invoice parts of an Order separately or together in one invoice.  All invoices shall be deemed accurate unless Customer advises Dell in writing of a material error within 10 days following receipt.  If Customer advises Dell of a material error, (i) any amounts corrected by Dell in writing shall be paid within 14 days of correction and (ii) all other amounts shall be paid by Customer by the due date.  If Customer withholds payment upon an assertion that an invoiced amount is erroneous, and Dell concludes that such amount is accurate, Customer shall pay interest as described below from the due date for such amounts until Dell\rquote s receipt of those amounts.  Customer may not offset, defer or deduct any invoiced amounts that Dell determines are not erroneous following the notification process set forth above. Any assignment of your payment obligations to a third-party financing company (other than Dell Financial Services, LLC) must be approved in advance in writing by Dell, and you will not be excused from your obligations under this Agreement. Dell may charge a late penalty of 1.5% per month on undisputed overdue amounts, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less.\~ Late penalties will be recalculated every 30 days based on your current outstanding balance.  Dell, without waiving any other rights or remedies and without liability to Customer, may suspend or terminate any or all Services and refuse additional orders for Products until all overdue amounts are paid in full.  Dell shall be entitled to all reasonable legal and attorney fees and associated costs of collecting overdue amounts.\b\par
\b0 v.\tab\b Taxes.\b0   You are responsible for sales tax and any other taxes or governmental fees associated with your Order.  \lang2057 If you qualify for a tax exemption, you must provide Dell with a valid certificate of exemption or other appropriate proof of exemption.  The charges stated on each line item of the invoice shall include all duties, levies or any similar charges and exclude VAT or equivalent sales or use tax.  Customer shall also pay all freight, insurance, and taxes (including but not limited to import or export duties, sales, use, value add, and excise taxes).  Dell\rquote s invoice shall be in accordance with applicable law.  If Customer is required by law to make a withholding or deduction from payment, Customer will make payments to Dell net of the required withholding or deduction.  Customer will supply to Dell satisfactory evidence (e.g. official withholding tax receipts) that Customer has accounted to the relevant authority for the sum withheld or deducted.\b\lang16393\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li720\ri720\b0\lang1033 vi.\tab\b Hardware Returns and Exchanges.\b0   You agree to Dell's return policy as stated at {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.dell.com/returnspolicy" }}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf2\ul dell.com/returnspolicy}}}}\f0\fs22 .  Before returning or exchanging Hardware, you must contact Dell to obtain an authorization number for your return.  You must return Hardware in its original or equivalent packaging, and you are responsible for risk of loss and shipping and handling fees.  Additional fees, including up to a 15% restocking fee, may apply.  If you fail to follow the return or exchange instructions, Dell will not be responsible for any loss, damage, or modification of Hardware, or processing of Hardware for disposal or resale.  Credit for partial returns may be less than invoice or individual component prices due to bundled or promotional pricing associated with your purchase.  Title to returned or exchanged Hardware shall pass to Dell upon receipt at the specified Dell facility.\b\par

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY SET FORTH IN THIS EULA, DELL\rquote S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EULA AND/OR THE SOFTWARE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF EITHER: A) THE TOTAL AMOUNT RECEIVED BY DELL FOR THE APPLICABLE SOFTWARE LICENSE DURING THE TWELVE MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH THE RELEVANT CLAIM AROSE OR B) THE AMOUNT RECEIVED BY DELL FOR THE SPECIFIC HARDWARE ON WHICH THE PARTICULAR SOFTWARE WAS LOADED. \par
Insofar as applicable law prohibits any limitation on liability herein, the parties agree that such limitation will be automatically modified, but only to the extent required to make the limitation compliant with applicable law. \par
\b 12. \ul Development Tools\ulnone .\b0  If the Software includes development tools, such as scripting tools, APIs ( application programming interface s), or sample scripts (collectively \ldblquote Development Tools\rdblquote ) and unless there is a separate agreement between you and Dell for the Development Tools, you may use such Development Tools to create new scripts and code for the purpose of customizing your use of the Software (within the parameters set forth in this EULA and within the parameters set forth in the Development Tools themselves ) and for no other purpose. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS EULA, THE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT INDEMNITY OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE. DELL BEARS NO LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM USE (OR ATTEMPTED USE) OF THE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS AND HAS NO DUTY TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO YOU.  \par
\b 13. \ul Evaluation Licenses\ulnone . \b0 This EULA does not license use of Software for evaluation purposes (\ldblquote Evaluation Software\rdblquote ). Your use of Evaluation Software is subject to the separate license terms and conditions accompanying that Evaluation Software. \par
\b 14. \ul Hosted and Internet-Accessible Software\ulnone .\b0  Some or all of the Software may be remotely hosted or accessible to you through the Internet (\ldblquote Hosted Software\rdblquote ). In such case, Dell may suspend, terminate, withdraw, or discontinue all or part of the Hosted Software or your access to the Hosted Software upon receipt of a subpoena or law-enforcement request, or when Dell believes, in its sole discretion that you have breached any term of this EULA or are involved in any fraudulent, misleading, or illegal activities. Dell may modify the Hosted Software at any time with or without prior notice to you. Dell may perform scheduled or unscheduled repairs or maintenance, or remotely patch or upgrade the Hosted Software installed on its and your system(s), which may temporarily degrade the quality of the Hosted Software or result in a partial or complete outage of the Hosted Software. Updates, patches or alerts may be delivered from Dell servers, which may be located outside of your country. Dell provides no assurance that you will receive advance notification of such activities or that your use of the Hosted Software will be uninterrupted or error-free.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720\ri720\b 15. \ul Open Source and Third Party Software\ulnone .\b0  The Software may come bundled or otherwise be distributed with open source or other third party software, which is subject to the terms and conditions of the specific license under which it is distributed. OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY DELL "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS EULA, AS IT RELATES TO ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, DELL SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,  HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF\~OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  Under certain open source software licenses, you are entitled to obtain the corresponding source files. You may find corresponding source files for the Software at {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://opensource.dell.com/" }}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf2\ul http://opensource.dell.com}}}}\f0\fs22  or other locations that may be specified to you by Dell.\par
\b 16. \ul High-Risk Disclaimer and Excluded Data\ulnone\b0 . The Software is not designed or intended for high-risk applications, for use as online control systems or use in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communications systems, air traffic control, life support, weapons systems or in any other device or system in which function or malfunction of the software could result in death, personal injury or physical or environmental damage.  Any such use or application by you is outside the scope of this license and you are not authorized to use the Software in any such application.  You acknowledge that Software provided under this EULA is not designed with security and access management for the processing and/or storage of the following categories of data and software: (A) classified data and software; (B) data and software controlled under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\ldblquote ITAR\rdblquote ); and (C) personally identifiable information that is subject to heightened security requirements as a result of your internal policies or practices or by law (collectively referred to as \ldblquote Excluded Data\rdblquote ). You hereby agree that you are solely responsible for reviewing data that the Software will provide to Dell (or to which Dell will have access) to ensure that it does not contain Excluded Data.\par
\b 17.  \ul Indemnification.\ulnone\b0   You, at your expense, shall defend and indemnify Dell against any claim, action or proceeding brought against Dell which arises from or is in any manner connected with your unauthorized use of the Software or that arises from your breach of any provision of this EULA.\par
\b 18. \ul Right to Preliminary and Injunctive Relief\ulnone . \b0 You agree that money damages would be an inadequate remedy for Dell in the event of a breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions set forth in this EULA; therefore, you agree that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any such provisions, Dell may, in addition to any other remedies to which it is entitled, be entitled to such preliminary or injunctive relief (including an order prohibiting you from taking actions in breach of such provisions), without the need for posting bond, and specific performance as may be appropriate to preserve all of Dell\rquote s rights. All rights and remedies afforded Dell by law shall be cumulative and not exclusive. \par
\b 19. \ul Choice of Law\ulnone . \b0 THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY CLAIMS UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY IN ANY WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATIONSHIPS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN SHALL BE GOVERNED AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, U.S.A., WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW AND EXCLUSIVE OF ANY PROVISIONS OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS. The parties agree that the provisions of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (\ldblquote UCITA\rdblquote ), as it may have been or hereafter may be in effect in any jurisdiction, shall not apply to this EULA, and the parties waive any and all rights they may have under any laws(s) adopting UCITA in any form.\par
\b 20. \ul Dispute Resolution and Binding Individual Arbitration\ulnone .\b0  ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE, OR CONTROVERSY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER PREEXISTING, PRESENT OR FUTURE, AND INCLUDING STATUTORY, COMMON LAW, INTENTIONAL TORT AND EQUITABLE CLAIMS) BETWEEN YOU AND DELL arising out of or in connection with this EULA, or the breach, termination or validity thereof SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.   If you are in the United States, the arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), or JAMS (if you are in Canada, arbitration will be at ADR Chambers pursuant to the general ADR Chambers Rules for Arbitration located at {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.adrchambers.com" }}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf2\ul www.adrchambers.com}}}}\f0\fs22 ).  Otherwise, the dispute shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (\ldblquote ICC\rdblquote ) by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with such rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language.  For any ICC arbitration, the place of the arbitration shall be Austin Texas or another commercial center reasonably chosen by the arbitration panel to ensure that the award resulting from the arbitration shall be of an international character and enforceable under the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. The arbitration panel shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court, including without limitation preliminary relief, injunctive relief and specific performance. Any award of the arbitration panel shall be final and binding immediately when rendered, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Neither you nor Dell shall be entitled to join, consolidate, or include any claims belonging to or alleged or arising from, by, or on behalf of any third party to an arbitration brought hereunder\b ,\b0  or arbitrate any claim as a class action, class representative, class member, or in a private attorney general capacity. The individual (non-class) nature of this dispute resolution provision goes to the essence of the parties' dispute resolution agreement, and if found unenforceable, the entire arbitration and dispute resolution provision shall be void. Consumer claimants (individuals whose transaction is intended for personal, family or household use) may elect to pursue their claims in small-claims court rather than arbitration.  Dell will be responsible for paying any individual consumer's arbitration/arbitrator fees.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dell may apply to any relevant government agency or any court of competent jurisdiction to preserve its rights under this EULA and to obtain any injunctive or preliminary relief, or any award of specific performance, to which it may be entitled, either against you or against a non-party; provided, however, that no such administrative or judicial authority shall have the right or power to render a judgment or award (or to enjoin the rendering of an arbitral award) for damages that may be due to or from either party under this EULA, which right and power shall be reserved exclusively to an arbitration panel proceeding in accordance herewith. \par
\b 21. \ul No Waiver\ulnone . \b0 No waiver of breach or failure to exercise any option, right, or privilege under the terms of this EULA on any occasion by Dell shall be construed to be a waiver of a subsequent breach or right to exercise any option, right, or privilege. \par
\b 22. \ul No Assignment\ulnone . \b0 Except as provided in Section 6,\b  \b0 Customer may not assign or transfer its interests, rights or obligations under this EULA, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily, by contract, or by merger (whether that party is the surviving or disappearing entity), stock or asset sale, consolidation, dissolution, through government action or order, or otherwise. Any attempt to assign this EULA without prior written consent from an authorized executive officer of Dell shall be null and void.\par
\b 23. \ul Entire Agreement\ulnone .\b0  Unless you have entered into another written agreement with respect to the Software which has been signed by you and an authorized representative of Dell and which conflicts with the terms of this EULA, you agree that this EULA supersedes all prior written or oral agreements, warranties or representations with respect to use of the Software. If any term (or part thereof) of this EULA is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions (including other valid parts within the effected term) will remain effective.  You acknowledge that you have read this Agreement, that you understand it, that you agree to be bound by its terms, and that this is the complete and exclusive statement of the Agreement between you and Dell regarding the Software.  \par

\par
For paid subscriptions, you accept change(s) to this Agreement by renewing the subscription, and the updated Agreement with the change(s) will be effective upon such renewal of your subscription.

\b 2.\tab License to Use\b0  \endash  \par
\b If you are accepting these terms for your personal non-commercial use in connection with the purchase of a consumer-branded Software or Service subscription (\ldblquote Consumer License\rdblquote ):\par
\b0\par

\pard\widctlpar\li1440\ri720 Subject to the terms of the Agreement, we grant to you a nonexclusive limited license: (i) to install and use any Software for which you have purchased a subscription for personal use only for the number of devices and users specified in your License Entitlement, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and subject to the System Requirements; and (ii) to use any Service for which you have purchased a subscription, for personal use only, as permitted under your Service Entitlement, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and subject to the System Requirements. This Consumer License does not provide any rights to any Small Business.\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\ri720\par
\b If you are accepting these terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity in connection with the purchase of a small business-branded Software or Service subscription (\ldblquote Small Business License\rdblquote ):\par

\pard\widctlpar\li1440\ri720\b0 Subject to the terms of the Agreement, and subject to registration of the Software by personnel employed by the Small Business (\ldblquote Users\rdblquote ), we grant to Company a non-exclusive and limited license for up to 250 Users to use the Software (i) on the number of Personal Computers for which the Small Business has purchased subscription licenses (for which a minimum purchase requirement may apply), and (ii) on Portable Devices; provided, that such use under subparts (i) and (ii) is only for the subscription term purchased by such Small Business, solely by such Users and solely for the internal business operations of the Small Business.  This limited license is subject to the restrictions and terms in the License Entitlement and the System Requirements.  \par
\par
Solely with respect to licenses to a Small Business, each subscription license that a Small Business purchases permits executing and using the Software on a single Personal Computer.  Use of a single User license on more than one Personal Computer is expressly forbidden.  However, Users may deploy the Software on an unlimited number of the Portable Devices that are regularly used in the operation of the business of the Small Business and that are either owned by the Small Business or Users.  \ldblquote Personal Computer\rdblquote  means a general purpose computer, laptop or desktop, which is running an operating system supported by the Software. \ldblquote Portable Devices\rdblquote  means a tablet or mobile device which is running an operating system supported by the Software.\par
\par
In addition, solely with respect to licenses to a Small Business, each license to the Software must be registered.  Registration is required in order to obtain technical support, in order to claim any included Virus Removal Service session per year of annual subscription per purchased license, and so that any licenses purchased in the future will have the same renewal date as the initially purchased licenses. Unused sessions do not roll-over to the next subscription year. It is the Small Business\rquote  obligation to ensure that someone within its organization has access to each registration account and the email address identified in the account profile in order to obtain support from us and to receive the pro-rata rate on additional license purchases described in Section 3.\par
\par
This Small Business License does not provide any rights to any individual consumer.\par
\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\ri720 This foregoing Consumer License or Small Business License, as applicable, (\ldblquote License\rdblquote ) is nontransferable and is revocable by us as provided in this Agreement.  This License terminates as set forth in Section 3.  You must immediately cease all use of Software and Services upon such termination.\par
\par
 \ldblquote License Entitlement\rdblquote  means the number and type of devices and users (including Users) that are permitted to use the Software, as specified on transaction documents associated with your purchased subscription, which (depending upon the channel from which you purchased the license) may include: the checkout payment page, a product description page on our website, the email confirmation that we send for the purchase, the package if purchased at a retail store, or another transactional document made available to you.  If no licensed device count and/or user count is specified on any of the foregoing, the License Entitlement is one device and one user. \par
\par
\ldblquote Service Entitlement\rdblquote  means the scope and duration of the services that you have purchased, as specified on transaction documents associated with your purchased subscription, which (depending upon the channel from which you purchased the license) may include: the checkout payment page, a product description page on our website, the email confirmation that we send for the purchase, the package if purchased at a retail store, or another transactional document made available to you.  If no scope or duration is specified on any of the foregoing, the Service Entitlement is to one device, for one user, for one year.  \par
\par
\ldblquote System Requirements\rdblquote  means the requirements set forth on our {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.mcafee.com/consumer/en-us/store/m0/system_requirements.html" }}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf2\cf2\ul website}}}}\f0\fs22 .  Your use of the Software and Services is limited to devices and operating systems we support, as specified in the System Requirements, and may be affected by the performance and compatibility of your hardware, software and Internet access.  Meeting system requirements is your responsibility and you are responsible for the cost of your equipment, which may include obtaining updates or upgrades from time to time in order to continue using the Software.  \par
\par
We, along with our suppliers and partners, retain ownership of our respective Software and Services and all rights related to the Software and Services, including all intellectual property rights.  The only rights we grant are those rights expressly stated in this Agreement.  Also, if you provide us any comments, information, opinions, or suggestions on the Software or Services, which we consider \ldblquote Feedback,\rdblquote  you agree to allow us to use your Feedback without restriction, for any purpose and without compensation, accounting or other obligation to you. \par
\par
\b 3. \tab Term of License\b0  \endash  For paid subscriptions, the License is effective for the subscription term you purchased and each subsequent term that you renew, unless terminated earlier or later as permitted below; and if no term was specified, the default term is one year from the date you first acquired the subscription.  Your renewal (or continued use after the subscription term) constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to the Agreement then in effect at such renewal or continued use period.  For Free Software and Courtesy Services, the License is effective for as long as the Free Software is installed or we otherwise make the Free Software or Courtesy Services available to you and will remain subject to any limitations in the License Entitlement or Service Entitlement, as applicable.  We may choose to provide you Free Software or a Courtesy Service prior to, during, or after your paid subscription and any use is subject to the terms of the Agreement then in effect for as long as the Free Software is installed or the Free Software or Courtesy Services are used.  We may terminate the License and/or the Agreement then in effect at our option if you fail to comply with or violate these terms and conditions.  You may also terminate the License prior to the expiration of the term by permanently erasing the Software from your devices and canceling your account with us.  If the License is terminated, you must stop using the Software and, if you have not done so, you must permanently erase all copies of the Software.  Unless terminated in accordance with this provision, the Agreement shall remain in effect for so long as you use or retain possession or control of any Software or Service.\par
\par
If the License and/or Agreement terminates for any reason or expires, you will no longer be authorized to use or access the Software or Services, including any online storage or backup services, and we may cancel and/or close your account at our sole discretion.  After the termination or expiration date, we will follow our standard policies to delete any of your online stored or backed-up information, text, files, links, images or other materials provided to us (\ldblquote Content\rdblquote ).  It is your responsibility to store or backup your Content elsewhere before the License and/or this Agreement expires or is terminated.  We are not responsible for giving you a copy of your Content.  Use of Software and Services, at all times, is governed by the terms of the Agreement then in effect.\par
\par
For Small Business Licenses only, if you purchase additional licenses of the Software which you registered to your account in the future and you use the email address identified in your account profile for the new purchases, the initial term of such licenses will be automatically reduced so that the renewal date is the same as the renewal date of the Software licenses you initially purchased.  In that event, you will be charged a prorated subscription price based on a calendar day basis for the reduced initial term.  If you do not register your initial licenses to your account, or you do not use the email associated with the account during checkout, you will receive no pro-rata pricing and the subscription term of such additional licenses will be the term that you purchased.\par

4. \tab PAYMENT, AUTOMATIC RENEWAL, CANCELLATION AND REFUND \endash  \par
Payment:\par
YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CHARGE THE CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD ACCOUNT OR OTHER PAYMENT DEVICE YOU PROVIDED FOR ALL AMOUNTS YOU OWE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY RENEWALS.  YOU AGREE TO NOTIFY US PROMPTLY OF ANY CHANGE IN YOUR CARD ACCOUNT NUMBER OR EXPIRATION DATE OR OTHER PAYMENT INFORMATION.  FOR CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WE MAY ALSO UPDATE SUCH INFORMATION WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF YOUR CARD ISSUER AND THE RELEVANT CARD NETWORK AND WE MAY USE THE UPDATED CARD INFORMATION TO CHARGE AMOUNTS YOU OWE US.  UNLESS YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, THIS WILL SERVE AS YOUR CONSENT FOR YOUR CARD OR PAYMENT DEVICE TO BE CHARGED.  \par
\par
\b0 You are responsible for any charges incurred with your data- or mobile-service provider in connection with your use of the Software, including any overage and penalties assessed for exceeding your data or minute allowance, or use of domestic or international short message service.\par
\par
\b Automatic Renewal:\par
\par
YOU AGREE TO ALLOW US TO AUTOMATICALLY RENEW YOUR PAID SUBSCRIPTION.  BEFORE YOUR TERM EXPIRES, WE WILL SEND A NOTICE TO THE E-MAIL ADDRESS IDENTIFIED IN YOUR ACCOUNT PROFILE, INFORMING YOU OF THE UPCOMING RENEWAL.  YOU WILL BE CHARGED THE UNDISCOUNTED SUBSCRIPTION PRICE FOR THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE AS LISTED ON OUR WEBSITE AT THE TIME OF RENEWAL, EXCLUDING ANY PROMOTIONAL OR DISCOUNT PRICING (\ldblquote UNDISCOUNTED SUBSCRIPTION PRICE\rdblquote ).  SUCH UNDISCOUNTED PRICING MAY BE FOUND ON OUR {\b0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.mcafee.com/consumer/en-us/store/m0/index.html" }}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf2\cf2\ul\b WEBSITE}}}}\f0\fs22 .  THIS PRICE MAY CHANGE DURING A SUBSCRIPTION TERM, AND MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE PRICE PAID FOR AN INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION OR MANUAL RENEWAL AND HIGHER THAN PROMOTIONAL OR DISCOUNTED PRICES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE AS OF THE DATE OF AUTOMATIC RENEWAL.  WE WILL SEND YOU VIA EMAIL A RECEIPT CONFIRMING THE RENEWAL DATE, PRICE, TERM AND ANY APPLICABLE TAXES.  IF, AT THE TIME OF RENEWAL, THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE HAS BEEN RENAMED, UPGRADED OR REPLACED BY A NEW OFFERING WITH REASONABLY COMPARABLE FEATURES (\ldblquote REPLACEMENT\rdblquote ), WE MAY, AT OUR DISCRETION, AUTOMATICALLY RENEW YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WITH THE REPLACEMENT FOR NO MORE THAN THE UNDISCOUNTED SUBSCRIPTION PRICE OF THE REPLACEMENT.\par
\par
UPON RENEWAL, THE NEW TERM WILL BE THE SAME LENGTH AS THE EXPIRED TERM UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED BY US AT THE TIME OF RENEWAL.  FOR SUBSCRIPTIONS OF ONE YEAR OR MORE, THE RENEWAL AND YOUR PAYMENT WILL BE PROCESSED WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE CURRENT TERM EXPIRATION DATE AND EACH ANNIVERSARY THEREAFTER.

\par
ANY TIME AFTER PURCHASING A SUBSCRIPTION, YOU MAY TURN OFF AUTOMATIC RENEWAL BY ACCESSING YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNT PAGE OR CONTACTING CUSTOMER SERVICE.  IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE AUTOMATICALLY RENEWED, YOU MUST TURN OFF AUTO-RENEWAL AT LEAST THIRTY DAYS BEFORE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION EXPIRES.  IF YOU DO NOT TURN OFF AUTO-RENEWAL, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL CONTINUE FOR THE RENEWAL TERM UNDER THE AGREEMENT IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF EACH RENEWAL UNLESS IT IS CANCELED BY YOU (OR TERMINATED BY US PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT). \par
\par
TURNING OFF AUTOMATIC RENEWAL WILL DISCONTINUE ANY PREMIUM FEATURES AND/OR SERVICES THAT WE OFFER EXCLUSIVELY TO SUBSCRIPTION CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE SIGNED UP FOR AUTOMATIC RENEWAL AND HAVE PROVIDED A VALID CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD ACCOUNT OR OTHER PAYMENT DEVICE.\par
\par
Cancellation:\par
\par
\b0 If you have a monthly subscription, cancelling will not result in a retroactive refund of subscription payments, and previously charged subscription fees will not be pro-rated based on cancellation date.  Cancelling a monthly subscription will stop the recurring fee going forward, and you will have access to your subscription until the end of the month in which you notified us of your cancellation.\par
\par
\b Refund:\par
\par
\b0 We offer a money-back guarantee on most Software and Services if you are not satisfied with your product for any reason.  However, eligibility for a refund depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the type of product, subscription term, duration since purchase, and where it was purchased.  Shipping, handling, and any applicable tax are not refundable except in certain states and countries where these items are refundable.  If you receive a refund for your purchase, you are obligated to uninstall the software.  In addition the Software might, at our sole discretion, be disabled to prevent further use.\par
\par
If you purchased an annual subscription to Software or a Service you must request a refund within 30 days of the subscription purchase.  We do not provide partial refunds.  The 30-day money back guarantee is not available for monthly subscribers.\par
\par
If your annual subscription has been automatically renewed, we will provide you a full refund if your request is made within 60 days of being charged.\par
\par

\par
Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes: any claim, dispute or controversy of any kind, regardless of the type of claim or legal theory or remedy (\ldblquote Claim\rdblquote ) by either you or us against the other arising from, relating to or in any way concerning the Agreement, the Software, or any equipment, products, or services you receive from us (or from any advertising for any such products or services) shall, at the demand of either party, be resolved by confidential binding arbitration.  \b0 This agreement to arbitrate also includes: (i)  claims relating to the enforceability or interpretation of any of these arbitration provisions; (ii)  Claims by you, and also Claims made on your behalf or connected with you, such as an employee, representative, agent, predecessor, successor, heir, assignee, or trustee in bankruptcy; (iii)  Claims that relate directly to us, and/or to our parent, affiliates, successors, assignees, employees, and agents; and (iv)  Claims asserted as part of a class action, private attorney general or other representative action, it being expressly understood and agreed to that the arbitration of such claims must proceed on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis and the arbitrator may award relief only on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis.  \b YOU AND WE AGREE THAT NO CLASS ACTION, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS MAY BE PURSUED IN ARBITRATION, NOR MAY SUCH ACTIONS BE PURSUED IN COURT.  BY ACCEPTING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO INITIATE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION IN ANY MATTER ENCOMPASSED BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION.\par
\b0\par
\b Notice of Dispute: \b0 The party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least 60 days in advance of initiating arbitration.  Notice should be sent to McAfee, 5000 Headquarters Drive, Plano, TX 75024, Attention: Legal Department.  The notice must include your name, address, and contact information, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested.  You and we will attempt to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within 60 days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent.  After 60 days, you or we may commence arbitration.\par
\par
\b Administration of Arbitration:\b0  If any dispute is not resolved by informal negotiation, any claim, dispute, or controversy will be, at the demand of either party, conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (\ldblquote FAA\rdblquote ), and not state law.  \b YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE (OR PARTICIPATE IN AS A PARTY OR CLASS MEMBER) ALL DISPUTES IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.\b0   Instead, all disputes will be resolved on an individual basis before a single, neutral arbitrator and the proceeding shall be confidential.  The arbitrator will be either a lawyer admitted to practice law in his or her jurisdiction and with at least ten years\rquote  experience or a retired or former judge selected in accordance with the rules of the AAA.  The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement, and the arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA, as modified by this Agreement (the \ldblquote Arbitration Rules\rdblquote ).  For more information, see adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879.  \par
\par
Except with respect to any claims or counterclaims seeking less than $25,000, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned, written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.  All arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English, and the United States FAA shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the binding arbitration clause in this Agreement.  The award shall be confidential and only disclosed as is necessary to obtain judgment or as otherwise required by law.  You and we further agree that a judgment may be entered upon the award by any court having jurisdiction.  The arbitration award shall determine the rights and obligations between the named parties only, and only in respect to the claims in arbitration, and shall not have any bearing on the rights and obligations of any other dispute. \par
\par
\b Costs: \b0 The party initiating the arbitration shall pay the initial filing fee.  If you file the arbitration and an award is rendered in your favor, we will reimburse your filing fee.  We will pay the fees and costs for the first day of any hearing.  All other fees and costs will be allocated in accordance with the arbitration rules.  However, we will advance or reimburse filing and other fees if the arbitrator rules that you cannot afford to pay them or if you ask us and we determine there is a good reason for doing so.  Each party shall bear the expense of their respective attorneys, experts, and witnesses and other expenses, regardless of who prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.\par
\par
\b Right to Resort to Provisional Remedies Preserved: \b0 Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit or constrain our right to resort to self-help remedies or to comply with legal process, or to obtain provisional remedies such as injunctive relief, attachment, or garnishment by a court having appropriate jurisdiction; provided, however, that you or we may elect to arbitrate any dispute related to such provisional remedies.\par
\par
\b Conflicting Terms:\b0  In the event of a conflict between the Arbitration Rules and this arbitration agreement, this arbitration agreement shall govern.  If any portion of this arbitration agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it shall not invalidate the other provisions of the arbitration agreement; provided, however, that (a) if the prohibition on classwide arbitration is deemed invalid, then this entire arbitration agreement shall be null and void; and (b) if the prohibition on arbitration of representative claims brought in a private attorney general capacity is deemed invalid, then the arbitration agreement shall be null and void as to such claims only.  This arbitration agreement shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.  In the event of a conflict between this arbitration agreement and any other applicable arbitration provision, this arbitration agreement shall control.\par
\par
\b WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL: IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL.  YOU AND WE UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY DISPUTE THAT IN ANY WAY RELATES TO OR ARISES OUT OF THE AGREEMENT OR FROM ANY EQUIPMENT, PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES YOU RECEIVE FROM US (OR FROM ANY ADVERTISING FOR ANY SUCH PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE OR SERVICES).  IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.\par

\b 12.\tab Attacks on Data\b0  \endash  You acknowledge that some security breaches involve attacks on data.  For example, there are viruses and other malware that: (i) delete or destroy your data (sometimes individual files, but sometimes even an entire disk by corrupting a master boot record or other key element); (ii) modify your files (such as parasitic malware that attaches itself to a file and modifies the file to enable its own execution and/or propagation); and (iii) encrypt files on your drive (such as ransomware that uses asymmetric encryption).  The best way for you to protect yourself from these types of attacks is frequent back-ups of your data to another device/location.  That way, you have another copy of the data that the attacking software has deleted, modified, or destroyed.  While we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove the attacking malware or virus, it is your sole and exclusive responsibility to back-up all data and files on your device so that they can be restored in the event of an attack on your data.  Without such a back-up, it may not be possible to restore the deleted/destroyed/modified data.
